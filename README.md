Read about the idea and its inception [in this document](https://cdn.foster.audio/files/MixUtilities%20-%20Automating%20live%20sound%20mixing%20consoles.pdf).

**mixutilities** is in early development. The goal is to eventually reach feature parity between as many mid-level digital desks as possible, including M32/X32, SQ, CL/QL. Builds have succeeded on macOS, Windows, and Linux, however there is limited dependency documentation at the moment. See `/wiki` for more.
